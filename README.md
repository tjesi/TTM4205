## Course Description

*The course covers how to implement, analyse, attack, protect and securely compose cryptographic algorithms in practice.  
It goes in depth on how to implement computer arithmetic, attacking implementations using side-channel attacks and fault  
injection, exploit padding oracles and low-entropy randomness, utilise techniques to defend against these attacks, and how  
to securely design misuse-resistant APIs.*

## Portfolio Assignment

The evaluation in this course will consist of three assignments of 100 points total.

### Weekly problems (40 points)

This assignment will contain the following kind of problems:

  - Pen & paper problems
  - Coding problems
  - CryptoHack problems

The submission deadline is <font color='red'>December 6th at 23:59</font>.

**The problems will be announced here.**

### ChipWhisperer lab (20 points)

This assignment will contain lab work using the ChipWhisperer equipment.

The submission deadline is <font color='red'>December 6th at 23:59</font>.

**The lab work will be announced here.**

### Technical Essay (40 points)

This assignment is to write a technical essay about either a topic not covered  
by the lectures, or to cover a topic from the lectures more in-depth. It is
mandatory for each group to present their work, but it does not impact the grade.

*Most important guidelines:*

  - Groups of 1-3 members
  - Essays of 10-20 pages
  - Essays written in LaTeX
  - Short oral presentations

*Deadlines:*

  - Topic/scope/group approval:     **November 1st**
  - Short oral presentations:       **TBA**
  - Draft submission for feedback:  **TBA**
  - Receive feedback on draft:      **December 6th**
  - Final submission: <font color='red'>December 20th at 23:59</font>.

**The problem description will be announced here.**

### Grading

You must pass all assignments to pass the course; at least 40% on each.

We will use the [official NTNU grading scale](https://i.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Grading+scale+using+percentage+points) to assign combined grades.

## Lecture Plan

We have the following sessions this semester: TBA.
